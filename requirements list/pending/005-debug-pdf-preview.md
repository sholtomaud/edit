# Requirement #5: Debug PDF Preview Component

**Status:** Pending

## Description

The PDF preview component is currently not rendering the generated PDF. The preview area remains blank, even when the underlying `jsPDF` object is correctly generating the document data.

## Rationale

A functioning PDF preview is critical for the user experience, providing immediate visual feedback on the LaTeX input. Without it, the application is not usable as an editor.

## Implementation Details

-   **Investigate `components/pdf-preview.js`:** This is the primary component responsible for displaying the PDF. The investigation should focus on how it receives the PDF data and renders it within the iframe.
-   **Check `datauristring` generation:** Ensure the `datauristring` generated by `pdf-generator.js` is valid and correctly formatted.
-   **Verify iframe interaction:** Confirm that the `src` attribute of the iframe is being updated correctly and that there are no cross-origin or security policy issues preventing the data URI from being displayed.
-   **Browser Console:** Check the browser's developer console for any errors related to `jsPDF`, the iframe, or content security policies.
